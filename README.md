# SemEval_Tweet_Sentiment_Analysis
A crack at applying some classic ML methods as well as a simple LSTM model to predict Tweet sentiment.

The Jupyter notebook highlights the pre-processing of Tweets, conversion of Tweets to a suitable feature space (Tf-Idf/GloVe) and finally training some models! These are all pretty standard NLP practices and nothing particularly fancy. The LSTM model certainly has room for improvement.
